# Coding-Ninja-Solution
  main point 
 make sure change class name according to the paltform name .
 for example 🦖  in coding ninja by default  class name is Solution or Main. 
 you have to change the name according to the platformn.
 but whrn you code in your local computer make sure the name of the class is same as the file save name : example 👍 you save your program with name Average_Marks then you have to give the class name as same as the file save name .  like _ public class Average_Marks {    .......   }
